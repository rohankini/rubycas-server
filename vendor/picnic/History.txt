=== 0.8.1.1 :: 2009-05-06

* The -c (--config file) option in the CLI interface was previously borken
  and had no effect. This has now been fixed.

=== 0.8.1 :: 2009-05-01

* The bundled version of camping has been updated so we are now compatible with 
  Passenger 2.2.
* We now attempt to check for app loading errors during startup, rather than
  waiting for the first request. This should make debugging bad Camping apps
  a bit easier.
* Mix bug fixes throughout.


=== 0.8.0 :: 2009-03-18

* Overhauled for Camping 2.0. Major changes throughout. Some things to
  watch out for:
  * Your app's bin script should now specify :app_file instead of :app_path,
    and :app_file should point to your Camping app's main .rb file.
  * Postamples for Mongrel and WEBrick are gone, since everything is now
    handled by Rack. It is also now possible to run Picnic apps on Phusion
    Passenger (mod_rails/mod_rack).

=== 0.7.1 :: 2008-11-10

* Fixed config file loading problems rooted in $APP_PATH inconsistencies.
  $APP_PATH is now set to the root of the application installation, rather than
  the bin or lib subdirectory.

=== 0.7.0 :: 2008-10-28

* Can now configure the CLI aspect of an app to respond to additional command-
  line flags. This is done by passing a block of OptionParser calls as
  an :extra_cli_options parameter to the Cli initializer.
* activerecord is no longer a requirement. However you should make sure that
  you take care of loading activerecord in your app if you intend to use
  Camping's database functionality.
  
=== 0.6.5 :: 2008-09-18

* Fixed compatibility with ActiveSupport 2.1.

=== 0.6.4 :: 2008-05-26

* Patched bundled Camping library to allow setting expiry time on cookies.
* CLI initializer can now be fed an alternate module name for your application.
  This will override the module that would have been guessed based on the
  app's name.
* Fixed bug where HTTPS operation didn't work under Webrick. You should now
  again be able to serve over HTTPS when using webrick by supplying the
  ssl_cert configuration option.
  See: http://code.google.com/p/rubycas-server/issues/detail?id=45
* Fixed bug where the log file was being truncuated whenever the server
  was started in daemon mode.

=== 0.6.3 :: 2008-03-14

* Fixed bug in mongrel postamble that prevented the server from starting when
  the log level was set to DEBUG.

=== 0.6.2 :: 2008-03-06

* Fixed some loading problems having to do with the new CAS authenticator
  introduced in 0.6.0.

=== 0.6.1 :: 2008-02-28

* Fixed bug introduced in 0.6.0 where webrick and mongrel postambles were
  broken for apps that don't define any public directories.
* Each public directory mount is now logged during startup. Also resolved
  some potential issues with the uri_path config option. Multiple /'s
  in the path are now automatically removed.

=== 0.6.0 :: 2008-02-26

* Added support for CAS authentication. See picnic/authentication.rb for 
  details.
* Webrick and Mongrel can now be made to bind to a specific IP address using
  the :bind_address option. If no :bind_address is specified, the server will
  listen on all addresses (i.e. '0.0.0.0').
* The Public controller for serving the '/public' directory is gone. It has
  been replaced by respective Webrick and Mongrel mechanisms for serving
  directory contents, since these are much faster. If you're using CGI/FastCGI,
  you'll have to manually configure your web server (i.e. probably Apache)
  to serve your public directory contents.
* The gem package now correctly recognizes markaby as a required
  dependency.

=== 0.5.0 :: 2007-12-20

* First public release.
